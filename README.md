# Face Liveness Detector

The Face Liveness Detector project aims to ensure the authenticity of facial recognition systems by detecting whether the face being presented is real or a fake (e.g., photo, video, or mask). Using advanced machine learning algorithms, this tool provides enhanced security for systems reliant on face verification.

# Key Features
Real-time Face Liveness Detection: Detects whether the face is live or fake in real-time, preventing spoofing attempts.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Uses sophisticated ML models to analyze facial features and detect fake representations.

Enhanced Security: Helps strengthen biometric systems and ensure only genuine faces are used for authentication.
